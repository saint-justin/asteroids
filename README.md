# ASTEROIDS
Asteroids, built in unity utilized vector-based physics and AABB collision.

## Controls
Navigate the main menu with the up/down arrow keys. Submit a selection with the enter/return key. Rotate the ship clockwise or counter-clockwise via the left/right arrow keys. Move forwards by pressing the up arrow key. Slow down by releasing the up arrow key. Fire your weapon forwards via the spacebar.

## Notes
Unity's post-processing stack broke at some point in the build process, meaning the trail created by the player character's ship looks soapy instead of looking like a set of colors firing out the back of a rocket ship. It is what it is. To see the intended version of how this _should_ look, check out my website at https://jvaughn.org/ and view the screenshots on there.
